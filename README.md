# Ray White Code Test
A Simple script to hit the Ray White test API and return and render data in the browser.

## Environment
This script is environment agnostic all that is required to run it is a modern web browser. This script requires jquery-3.1.1 which is compatible with IE8 and above.


## Usage Instructions
To run simply drag index.html into your browser or enter the file path.

## Thought Process
I started out by read the instructions through a couple of times until I was sure what was being asked of me. I chose to complete the exercise in Javascript using jQuery, Javascript because this is the technology that I am currently most interested in and jQuery because I am fairly confident with it's use. This also allowed me to complete the exercise without creating a complicated environment.

## How I worked
I broke the exercise down into each step of functionality that was required and worked through piece by piece.


## What Could Be Improved
To improve this application I would definitely write tests. Also if I had more time I would have written it in React at this would have enabled a nicer separation of concern between the markup and the JS.
